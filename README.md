# Identifying Menu Items Driving Restaurant Rating Volatility

**Overview:**

This project analyzes restaurant rating data to identify specific menu items that significantly contribute to the volatility of a restaurant's overall rating. By correlating item-level performance (ratings and review sentiment) with overall rating fluctuations, we aim to pinpoint menu items that are either consistently driving positive reviews or causing negative impacts. This analysis provides valuable insights for menu optimization, enabling restaurants to improve customer satisfaction and stabilize their online reputation.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy (implicitly used by other libraries)

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script assumes the input data is in a CSV file named `restaurant_data.csv` located in the same directory as the script.  The exact format of `restaurant_data.csv` will be specified in a separate data dictionary file (if applicable).


**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key findings such as:

* Menu items with the highest positive correlation to overall rating increases.
* Menu items with the highest negative correlation to overall rating decreases.
* Statistical significance measures for identified correlations.


Additionally, the script will generate visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate the relationships between menu item performance and overall restaurant rating volatility. These visualizations will be saved as PNG files in the `output` directory (which will be created if it doesn't exist).  For example, a plot visualizing the correlation between a specific item's rating and overall restaurant rating might be saved as `item_correlation_plot.png`.  The exact names of generated files may vary.


**Data:**

The project requires a properly formatted CSV file named `restaurant_data.csv`.  A template or example of the required data format will be provided separately.  Please ensure your data file is correctly structured before running the script.
